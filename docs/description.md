<!-- BANNER -->

This is a quick stripped-down version of Stefan van den Akker's [Power Format Pack add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389). It is designed to work with Anki 2.1, but it is only meant as a holdover until someone finds the time to port PFP in its entirety (or until similar features arrive in Anki itself). Please don't expect any further major additions like markdown support, etc.

### Configuration

The add-on offers some limited configuration capabilities, but they are not as fleshed out nor as user-friendly as PFP. You will have to use Anki 2.1's built-in config manager to update the config dictionary (Tools → Add-ons → Select Mini Format Pack → Click configure). 

The properties  you can modify include:

- `hotkey` and `tooltip` of each action
- order of actions (by shifting the `{}`-enclosed button definitions around)
- available actions (by deleting any of the `{}`-enclosed button definitions)

Your changes will be applied once you restart your editor window (if running). Please do not change the '`name`' property, as this is used to assign the corresponding button to the function it calls.
